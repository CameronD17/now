# [now.camerondoyle.co.uk] (http://now.camerondoyle.co.uk)

now.camerondoyle.co.uk is where I keep my personal life updates. I rarely use Facebook or Twitter anymore, so once a month or so I post updates here. You can read more about now pages at [nownownow.com](http://nownownow.com/about)

The site is generated using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), and built on the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework.
