- I've handed in my resignation with CGI, and I'm starting a new job in Edinburgh at the beginning of April. It's quite the upheaval, and I'm considering this to be my 'major life event' that I [talked about on my birthday](http://blog.camerondoyle.co.uk/quarter/)
- Right now, I'm seriously neglecting my projects. Aside from this new-ish Now section, I haven't developed anything new for the first quarter of 2017 :(
- I'm still just about on track with my blog post writing target of [1 blog post per week](http://blog.camerondoyle.co.uk/). I'm already feeling a little lethargic and forcing out writing though, so I think after 2017 I'll revert back to as-and-when I feel like writing.
- Just finished booking everything for Canada in May! Travel insurance and my International Driving Permit are the only things I still need to sort out.
- Last week I finished [Couch to 5k](http://blog.camerondoyle.co.uk/couch-to-5k/) successfully, and I've signed up to do the EMF 10k in May after I get back from Canada.
- Still reading *How to Win Friends and Influence People*, by Dale Carnegie. This is only the second book of 2017, so I'm behind on my one-book-a-month target already! I have two more books lined up for after this though; *Born to Run* by Christopher McDougall, and Matt Haig's work of fiction *The Last Family in England*, both of which I'm excited to get stuck into.
