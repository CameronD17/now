- Currently in Portland, Oregon! Just arrived today after a few days in Seattle - I'll be back in the UK in a couple of weeks.
- I've started a new job in Edinburgh at Avaloq, as a software engineer. It's been about six weeks and I'm loving it so far - but it's draining, and I've had no motivation for projects recently.
- Still just about on track with my blog post writing target of [1 blog post per week](http://blog.camerondoyle.co.uk/). I'm already feeling a little lethargic and forcing out writing though, so I think after 2017 is over I'll revert back to as-and-when I feel like writing.
- Just finished my [10km training plan](http://blog.camerondoyle.co.uk/bridge-to-10k), and will be running the Edinburgh Marathon Festival 10km race the weekend I get back from Vancouver - hopefully I won't be too jetlagged.
- I've just read *The Last Family in England* by Matt Haig - very good book, but a very sad and depressing read too. Would recommend. I've also started *Born to Run* by Christopher McDougall; good so far, but I haven't read enough to give a good review yet.
